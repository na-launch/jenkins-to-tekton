Unlike Jenkins, which may require additional\nsetup (like managing multiple Jenkins agents), Tekton pipelines can scale automatically\nby running tasks in parallel across multiple pods in the Kubernetes cluster.\nThis means:\n- **Elastic Scalability**: As the demand grows (more code commits, more builds), Tekton\n  can spin up more pods to handle the increased load.\n- **Resource Efficiency**: Tekton allows you to define resource limits (CPU/memory)\n  for each task, making it easier to optimize resource usage.\n- **Faster Execution**: Since tasks are containerized and Kubernetes manages the execution\n  across nodes, Tekton pipelines can potentially run faster than Jenkins pipelines, which\n  may require manual resource management or additional infrastructure like Jenkins agents."}

In Tekton, pipelines are similarly defined in stages, but they are\ncalled **tasks**, and each task runs in a separate Kubernetes pod. Here's how you can\nmap Jenkins pipeline stages to Tekton tasks:\n- **Jenkins Stage** → **Tekton Task**:\n  Each Jenkins stage becomes a Tekton task. For example, a `build` stage in Jenkins\n  would become a `build-task` in Tekton. Each task can be modular and reused in other pipelines.\n- **Jenkins Steps** → **Tekton Task Steps**:\n  In Jenkins, a stage contains individual steps (e.g., commands or scripts). In Tekton,\n  each step in a task represents a container running a command or script. Tekton tasks\n  can contain multiple steps, each defined with its own container.\n- **Jenkins Pipeline Environment Variables** → **Tekton PipelineParams**:\n  Jenkins environment variables used within stages can be translated into **PipelineParams**\n  in Tekton, which allow passing values between tasks.\nExample:\nJenkins pipeline stage:\n```groovy\n    stage('Build') {\n      steps {\n        script {\n          sh 'make build'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\nTekton task:\n```yaml\n  apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1\n  kind: Task\n  metadata:\n    name: build-task\n  spec:\n    steps:\n      - name: build\n        image: golang:1.16\n        script: |\n          make build\n```"}
