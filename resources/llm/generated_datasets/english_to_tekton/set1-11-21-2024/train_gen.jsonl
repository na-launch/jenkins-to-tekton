It also supports string substitution, enabling you to reference string, array indexing, or object value of a param/result.\n\nTo guard a task and its dependent tasks, you can cascade the `when` expressions to specific dependent tasks or compose the task and its dependent tasks as a unit using Pipelines in Pipelines.
