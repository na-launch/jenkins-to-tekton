The pipeline then consists of three stages: Build, Quality Analysis, and Build and Publish  
Image. Each stage has its own agent configuration, defining where the jobs will run, be it  
on a specific agent or any available one.                                                   
                                                                                            
The 'Build' stage uses Maven to clean, run findbugs analysis, and package the application.  
If the build steps are successful, it archives the target jar file. The 'Quality Analysis'  
stage runs integration tests and Sonar Scan in parallel, using different agents for each    
task.                                                                                       
                                                                                            
Finally, the 'Build and Publish Image' stage is executed only on the master branch. It      
builds a Docker image with the defined IMAGE and VERSION tags and pushes it to a registry.  
The pipeline concludes by notifying users via email when a failure occurs.
